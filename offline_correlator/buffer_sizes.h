/* We now have to buffer at least 1 seconds worth of data. ).5 seconds worth of data is being processed and the next 0.5 seconds is being loaded
 * perhaps another 0.5 seconds of data for security
 *
 * This is broken up into frequencies. Each PACKET contains a single timesample from 4 groups of 4 channels. But 500 timesamples are present before the channel group increments.
 *
 * So the very smallest atomic size in time is a 500 packets (500*10us) - 50ms
 * TARGET_BUFSZ contains 50ms worth of data for 16 (conseq.) channels - or 2000 packets. Each data lane from the PFB has a allocation of 384 channels - therefore there are 96 sets of 500 packets covering the whole
 * allocation for that PFB lane.
 *
 * So for 32T - in order to process the whole bandpass we need to  48000 packets from each of 8 data lanes. Which in size is
 *
 * ATOM * 96 * NCAPTURE == 106.25MB
 *
 * But this only represents 500 time samples - (500 * E-4) = 0.05s (datarate is 2.120 GB/s)
 *
 * In order to get 0.5 s we need to add together 10 of these ~ 1GB
 *
 * And in order to have ~ 4 of them for "safety" we are talking 4GB
 *
 * But only ~1GB of it has to be the pinned memory - we should be fine.
 *
 * This means that the gpu library should be compiled with NTIME = 5000 NTIME_PIPE = 500.
 *
 *
 * I've increased NTIME_PER_PROCESSING BLOCK to 20. As this is the natural size of the pfb output
 *
 * But means that each buffer is 2.12GB of raw data and 4.2GB of "expanded" data. - It could be even larger - but the important thing is
 * that it needs to be pinned .... which could create a problem with the GPU.
 *
 * Note that the gpu only has to load in a 20th of this at a time - but the whole lot needs to be pinned.
